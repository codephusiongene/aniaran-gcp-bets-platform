# About Greg – Leadership in 4 Steps

This is the 1‑minute structure you can use when asked: **"Tell us about yourself."**

1. **Vision & Alignment** – translate business needs into a clear roadmap.  
2. **Architecture & Governance First** – define ingestion, processing, storage, security & serving before coding.  
3. **Modular, Portable Execution** – containerized, CI/CD-enabled, well-documented delivery.  
4. **Ops-Ready Delivery** – monitoring, data quality checks, alerting and cost controls baked in.
